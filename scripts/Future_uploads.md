I have multiple scripts that I have used for a range of applications, but which at the moment are not optimised for sharing, and they are not stand-alone. Currently working on optimising the following functions:

1. Build radial and angular matrices to work in polar coordinates.
2. Multiscale image enhancement
3. Scanning window to detect and analyse rod-like objects
